# Prediction_and_Data_Analysis_on_Employee_Attrition

The project will assist in determining which variables contributed the most to employee turnover and in developing a model that can forecast whether a certain employee would quit the organization. The purpose is to develop or improve various retention methods for certain personnel and have an idea of resource planning. Overall, the use of this approach will enable any business management to make better decisions.

The objective is to determine the rate of employee attrition, the variables that cause employee attrition, which employees are likely to leave, and which are likely to stay. We will achieve this by fitting a model that can predict the discrete class of new input using machine learning classification algorithms and visualization. Also, we can use this dataset for discovering and visualizing key factors affecting the rate of employee attrition. Moreover, by providing for the prediction can result in an efficient model which can be used by different organizations to decrease the rate of attrition and improve the factors that affected the rate of attrition in the company. 

Single employees have the highest attrition rate compared to married and divorced employees. However, the difference is not very significant, thus, we can conclude that marital status is not an important factor in employee attrition.
